Your Python project, titled "Text to Speech," utilizes the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface. The primary functionality of the application is to convert written text into spoken words. Users can input text into the application, and upon triggering the conversion process, the program employs text-to-speech functionality to audibly output the provided text.

Key features of your project may include:

User Interface: The Tkinter library is used to create a simple and intuitive graphical interface, allowing users to interact with the application.

Text Input: Users can enter the desired text into a designated input field within the application.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: The core functionality involves using a text-to-speech library or API to convert the entered text into audible speech.

Conversion Trigger: A mechanism, such as a button or command, is implemented to initiate the text-to-speech conversion process.

Output: The converted speech is played back through the computer's audio system, enabling users to hear the spoken version of the input text.

This project is particularly useful for individuals who may benefit from an auditory representation of written text, such as those with visual impairments or anyone looking for a convenient way to consume textual information hands-free. The simplicity and effectiveness of the "Text to Speech" project make it a practical and accessible tool for various users.
