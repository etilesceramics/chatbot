Active Learning (subset of machine learning) is a kind of query-based learning
where the user queries for specific inforaation based on a certain region of interest.

The fundamental assumption behind the active learner algorithm concept is that an Ml
algorithm could potentially reach a higher level of accuracy while using a smaller 
number of training labels if it were allowed to choose the data it wants to learn 
from.

Building CB based on AL
Instead of storing each instance in the	memory the learner can exploit from the 
hypothesis postulated by AL that user has the liberty to choose the data to learn 
from specific to the learning algorithm.
SO in comparison to regular ML algorithms where we randoaly picked up the
instances we can employ AL to do it more smartly in an interactive approach.

examples for AL
a)Speech recognition: Accurate labeling of speech utterances is time consUming 
and requires expertise ,annotation at word level can take ten times longer than 
actual audio,and annotating phonemes can take 400 times as long,

b)document classifcation and filtering : learning to classify documents or any
kind of media requires that users label each document or media file with particular
labels, like relevant or irrelevant.
